almost 40  minutes, which left me feeling relieved that he was not still in
his preparation. Still, things are not really easy for Black. His coordination
is somewhat worse than it usually is in the hedgehog, and I found it hard to
find constructive waiting moves.} 16. Rac1 {h4 or Nf3 could also be considered,

better for White, but I was rather worried that I would blow it before the

nothing had happened. Of course, only further practice will prove whether the
